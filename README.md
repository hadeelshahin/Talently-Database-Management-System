"# Talently-Database-Management-System" 

**Project Summary: Talently Database Management System**

Talently is a MySQL-based relational database management system project aimed at effectively managing user, company, and conversation data. Focused primarily on SQL data definition language (DDL), the project emphasizes the creation and alteration of tables, alongside the implementation of various constraints and data integrity measures.

Key Features:

1. **Data Definition**: Utilizes SQL commands like `CREATE DATABASE`, `CREATE TABLE`, and `ALTER TABLE` for effective schema definition.

2. **Table Creation**: Includes creation of three core tables: `User`, `Company`, and `Conversation`, each tailored to specific data requirements.

3. **Constraints Implementation**: Enforces data integrity through constraints such as `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, and primary key constraints. Utilizes `ID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT` for unique identifier generation.

4. **Table Updates**: Allows dynamic table updates, including addition of constraints, altering text encoding, and modifying collation settings.

5. **Advanced Table Concepts**: Incorporates advanced concepts like temporary tables, tables created from other tables, and generated columns for automated data population.
